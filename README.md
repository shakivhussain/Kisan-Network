# ðŸŒŸ Welcome To Kisan Network Project! ðŸŒŸ

This Android application is developed using the Kotlin language and utilizes various technologies such as Room, Dagger 2, Retrofit, Navigation Component, Twilio, MVVM architecture, Material Components for Android, Android Architecture Components, Coroutines, Flow, and ViewBinding etc.


## Built With ðŸ› 

- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) - First class and official programming language for Android development.
- [Coroutines and Flow](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) - For asynchronous and more..
- [Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture) - Collection of libraries that help you design robust, testable, and maintainable apps.
  - [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - Stores UI-related data that isn't destroyed on UI changes. 
  - [ViewBinding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding) - Generates a binding class for each XML layout file present in that module and allows you to more easily write code that interacts with views.
- [Navigation Graph](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-design-graph) - The Navigation component uses a navigation graph to manage your app's navigation.  
- [Room](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/arch/persistence/room/RoomDatabase) - Room is an Android Library used for local data storage in the application. In this application, Room is used to store the contacts list locally in the device's database.
- [Dagger 2](https://dagger.dev/) - Dependency Injection Framework
- [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) - A type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java.
- [MVVM Architecture ]() : The application follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern, which separates the business logic from the user interface. This architecture pattern makes the application easier to test, maintain and scale.
- [Material Components for Android](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android) - Modular and customizable Material Design UI components for Android.


## Conclusion ðŸ™Œ
Overall, this Android application is designed to provide an efficient and user-friendly experience for managing contacts and communication via SMS. 
By utilizing the latest technologies and architecture patterns, the application is more scalable, maintainable, and robust. 
The use of Twilio for SMS messaging, along with Material Components for Android, makes for a modern and consistent user interface. With Room, Dagger 2, Retrofit, Navigation Component, MVVM architecture, Android Architecture Components, Coroutines, Flow, and ViewBinding, this application provides a well-organized and efficient codebase.
